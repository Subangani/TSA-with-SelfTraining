The only reason Dustin Johnson didn't play  well is because it's a Sunday.  Luckily for him the final round is on Monday.  #TheOpen2015
Dustin Johnson staggeringly bogeys 18th after 3 putts from off front of the green. He'll rue that round for years. A 75 to be -7. #TheOpen
.@NoLayingUp Paul Dunne should rock shorts tomorrow because as an amateur he can. #TourSauce

If v leave Yakub today, tomorrow again he ll kill 257 innocent people. What kind of justice,is it?#YakubDebate
I think Tushar Gandhi should hang himself to protest against hanging of Yakub.And yes it should be on 29th just day B4 30th #yakubdebate

Listening to Bad Blood on the radio 1st time: this is awful 8: people like this? 15: that bass line isn't so bad  Now: NOW WE GOT BAD BLOOD
Victims are late.. with Mukul Rohtagi there is no chance that Yakub will be Hanged on 31st..
Yakub may not be hanged because Hindus are not united. This is the sad and bitter truth. Live with it.
@sebpatrick I'm seeing Ant-Man tomorrow. If it has an ant called Antony, and that ant dies, if this is a spoiler, I will be so mad at you.

@AsimBajwaISPR ur terrorist is going to be hanged tomorrow Yakub. stop sending terrorist u failed nation!!
Ant-Man tomorrow. Looking forward to it, but some asshole ruined it for me.
@NeelakshiGswm @kavita_krishnan Kaash  she will commit suicide if yakub will be hanged tomorrow '' DOUBLE BONUS" wow
Very bad idea 2 allow the dead body of Yakub to come to Mumbai-situation may become evn more tense @Dev_Fadnavis @HMOIndia @BJPRajnathSingh
one may argue yakub has gone thro process. hanging on his birthday is bigger message and scar to paki lovers. dangerous game has just begun
if Yakub had faith in Indian Judicial System that he came back, why did he blow up people in Mar-93 as justice for riot victims?
Would love to watch the live screening of Yakub being hanged tomorrow... #YakubVerdict
@mihirssharma Hey fucker! Cry as much u want.Ur "bother" Yakub is going to be hang tomorrow.Suck it bitch.
Do not miss the point. Today it is for Yakub. Tomorrow the candles will burn for rapists on death row. These same feminists will light them.
@brownbrumby Agree with 2nd part,but Yakub is no reason. Best logical argument against his hanging by @Raghav_Bahl. @YRDeshmukh @asadowaisi
I wish Mani Shankar Aiyar commit suicide tonight to meet Yakub tomorrow in hell
@Flipkart @MotorolaIndia Flipkart isn't letting me exchange my Moto G 2nd gen mobile. They are cancelling my orders. You just lost a buyer.
#YakubToHang Matter of fate; Yakub to be hanged tomorrow on his b'day. Apart 4rm all v sud nt forget dat he is being paid off 4 his sins.
Yakub death may be unfortunate bt we shud respect SC's decision n not vitiate atmosphere in the name of religion #YakubToHang #YakubVerdict
Yakub meman    Going to hang the credibility of Indian judiciary tomorrow. Rules for mercy and humqnity not for rope.
Hulk Hogan. More like Bulk Fooligan. Some folks never know when it's time to leave the room. He's had his day in the sun. Time to go away!
All stoned with weed march to Jantar Mantar. LOL. Y don't @kavita_krishnan volunteer to be hanged instead of Yakub? https://t.co/BgAc4fZYZG
Worse ! Yakub was the polished thinktank CEO, Tiger was the roughneck shop-floor-Foreman of this evil-enterprise !  https://t.co/o3Bd4HrluE
The most conclusive argument against the bleeding hearts and why logic doesn't hold for them in Yakub's hanging. https://t.co/RrlAj1K9aN
@SappyReDevil Yakub has to be hanged and he will definitely be hanged at 7 am tomorrow morning. Birthday = death day.
#YakubVerdict: my 11yr old exclaimed, tomorrow will be the worst birthday for Yakub but his 1st bday was worst for the country! Makes sense
@rupasubramanya your arguments may be valid in an overarching debate on DP. Too late in the game now for Yakub. Folks shut have spoken...
~ for, but worst of all, he's cheated the WWE Universe out of what they truly deserve. Monday night was just beginning, if Seth Rollins is ~

If all the 297 traitors sign an affidavit to be hung instead of Yakub, SM might recommend Yakub to be released tomorrow.  Ur time starts now
Pranab Mukherjee has just again rejected Yakub's 2nd mercy petition, hanging would be on as per schedule at 7am tomorrow #HangYakubNow .
Spare me the nuances, Yakub is certainly not innocent. Rarest of the rare case? May be! #YakubToHang
Still not clear whether Yakub will be hanged Thursday! One more challenge to his death sentence in the SC
I want to hear yakub dead, when I wake up tomorrow #HangYakub
Why is Stone Cold on the cover of #WWE2K16? He's hardly ever on anymore. Seth Rollins would be better. This may declare a no buy for me!
Hulk Hogan may have made some racist remarks.  On a larger note he made his no-talent behemoth of a daughter famous.
If something wrong happen tomorrow due to Yakub death sentence, media should be blame for it. They r making it more sensitive. #YakubToHang
Yakub's hanging may have created a fear in the minds of the terrorists, but it hasn't created any difference in our country
@tajinderbagga No issues if he is saving an innocent of any religion, but Yakub killed hundreds of innocent, tomo Bhushan may back ISIS too!
Why Yakub is so scared of death, when he is sure of getting 72 virgins tomorrow? Why Siculars are denying Allah's guaranteed reward? Sad.
I don't have Faith on  constitution.Sorry to Yakub's family.. May God bless Yakub's soul with rest and peace in heaven.Hang rapist first..
I think aftr seeing all this #YakubToHang drama, the security guy at d jail would like to shoot Yakub dead rather than hanging him tomorrow
Dr. going to see lot of people of stomach pain due to yakub's hanging tomorrow @abhijeetsinger @sardesairajdeep @MrsGandhi @smitaprakash
And even after all the petitions, all the hearings, someone will say tomorrow that Yakub didn't get a fair trial.

@ndtv Y don't u ask ur reporters to collect pottys of Yakub menon so tomorrow you can sell it as Secular fertiliser..rubbish reporting shame
News channels should stop telecasting the Yakub's news. It may lead 2 communal disturbance. Rather they can cover Abdul Kalam's last journey
Yakub has gone. whatever happened may be right. I want asked Kiran bedi .that whatever Yakub done.it was wrong  but after Babri masjid --
@D_J_Harvey I think they may want a guy with back problems. Here, have Ryan Braun!
Tomorrow they will discuss #YakubHanged after their Friday prayer. Bad part is 100s of youth will get inspired to be the next Yakub.
Yakub may or may not hav deseved death but he definitely deservd life imprisonment 4his deeds.Shame on those who are painting him as a saint
Actually today was Yakub's birthday. I wish him many many returns of this day. May he hang in hell too.!!

This pic worry all "Seculars" too.... the way they created sympathy for Yakub, may create many more such with that..  http://t.co/thLcx5Mkwf
One may argue if hanging Yakub was right or wrong. But the people who are trying to portray him as a communal hero are purely anti-national
@Atheist_Club look I can understand the argument for abolishing death penalty. You may have a point. But remorse for Yakub? Give me a break
@flipkartsupport are you kidding me? I want to replace my old phone with Moto G 3rd Gen at any cost. Do anything. It's not my fault.
All those who petitioned for stopping Yakub's hanging , may hang themselves ...This would be the best  "Shraddhanjali" to him
@thanthitv It seems that PMK leader may be wrongly advised about Yakub acts.PMK leader may think that he is patriot.

I would say the same thing Paul Dunne said about nerves on first tee tomorrow "just make contact with the ball"
Paul Dunne, amateur co-leader at The Open, entered the tourney at 1500:1 odds (via @Oddschecker) and entered Sunday at 300:1 @LVSuperBook.
@DanWolken there's just something about Sunday's that throws Dustin Johnson off. Maybe he can get back going on Monday.

Totally just realized Paul Dunne won't get a cent of the 1.8M first place prize if he wins #TheOpen tomorrow.
My brother on Dustin Johnson 'it wasn't the fourth round but he still choked on Sunday'
Despite sitting in solo 4th, Jordan Spieth is the favorite (+275) to win British Open. Can still get +1960 on co-leader Paul Dunne.
George Osborne recently parked his tanks on Labour's lawn. Now he's turned off the engines: http://t.co/Ua1TEwHkMW
Dustin Johnson knew it was tomorrow he was supposed to choke right, even though it's Sunday.
Maybe Dustin Johnson (-7) prefers the Final Round of the Open tomorrow, Sundays have not been his best days; (+3) on a day where many were -
Hi @SkySportsGolf is it possible for Paul dunne to turn from amateur to pro between 3rd and 4th rounds of Open. #solveabet

Apparently, it's National Ice Cream Day. I didn't get the memo. Sorry. I'll get us some tomorrow.
Imagine if Paul Dunne wins the Open tomorrow and some nonce had a bet on him at 1500/1...
Really hope Dustin Johnson shoots something in the low 60's tomorrow and is at least in contention. So many haters out there.
Has Randy Orton just thought about bringing a sun lamp and using it on Shamus to end the match? #WWEBattleground
