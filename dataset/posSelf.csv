Ant-Man feels like a rough 1st draft of the Marvel universe (namely Iron Man) which it probably was, considering it's where it all started.
Your soul may belong to the devil but your ass belongs to my client Brock Lesnar Undertaker my fav but that line was classic @HeymanHustle

Monday is my favorite day of the week because you can get any size iced coffee for $1 at Dunkin
Hey it's Monday! Which means Monday Night RAW tonight! Which means The Undertaker &amp; Brock Lesnar!!
Okay, I forgive the makers of Ant-Man for omitting Jan Pym. It's a funny, exciting, heist film with a lot of honor to dads. Go see it.
The most exciting part of Paper Towns was the instrumental version of Fourth of July by Fall Out Boy that played in the middle of the movie
Tickets to see Ant-Man with @HannaK108 and @TheLostLaurens this Friday! Looking forward to it, heard such mixed reactions to the film

Going to go watch the "Paper Towns" movie tomorrow. Excited! Have you guys seen it, yet? Is it good? I've never read the book before.
My favorite part of Paper Towns may have been the Ansel Elgort appearance
Just saw the trailer for 12 rounds with Dean Ambrose. Yeah that September 11th is going to be good.
@blakersims no shit? he looks awesome. Randy Orton in the 2nd one made me uncomfortable.
The 15 seconds of fame Ansel gets in Paper Towns may have been the best part....
Escape the Room this weekend, 3rd Row Phillies next weekend, Jason Aldean Aug 15 if I can win tickets! #BirthdayMonth
Sooo I wanna go see Paper Towns tomorrow with someone who actually read the book...
Loved the Today Show peeps on 3rd installment of "Sharknado"!! @TODAYshow   @SharknadoFans
@9ratna_9 told you because you said "Generally 15 August comes near Eid week". It happens for only 2 years after every 30 years. :)
Can't overstate the importance of Kris Bryant's walk-off HR after being swept over the weekend and blowing a 3R lead in the 9th tonight.
Kris Bryant will make October 7th come faster don't worry everyone.

@SurlyNurseJoy New Iron Maiden album on the 4th of September~ Has their longest eversong on it, which is why that reminded me.
@MissWhit83 If you were told you were going to lose to Floyd Mayweather in the 5th round you'd be rightly concerned about the first 4 rounds
I do claim Brock Lesnar as one of the best UFC fighters ever because he is the 2nd person EVER to win the title in only his 4th pro fight.
Spent the last hour listening to Van Halen, can't believe I've not listened before! Tomorrow it will be Iron Maiden. Holiday tunes sorted.
I would say, Ant-Man is probably my favorite movie of the year so far with MI: Rogue Nation at a very close 2nd
Someone go see Zac Brown Band with me September 12!!

It's the Saturday of a long weekend and I'm at home watching Sharknado. This is my new life.
The fact that Bailey is bringing Dunkin into work tomorrow, is the only thing keeping me motivated to wake up in the morning.
everyone needs to watch the live streamed Sir Paul McCartney set @lollapalooza is showcasing tomorrow night. can't wait to reminisce.
Who wants to go see Ant-Man tomorrow? I believe it's a film about a man who's imbued with all the powers of a guy named Anthony.
New blog, nice conversations with friends (both staying in the deepest pits of hell) and going to see Paper Towns tomorrow. Good shit.

What's a better way to end off the August long than David Price's 8IP 11k's?  SCRUFFY MURPHY'S TRIVIA TONIGHT 9pm ;)  Gonna be a great show

90% of my love for the WWE comes from watching Seth Rollins get punched in the face. Ready for Monday night RAW
my monday has consisted of Paul McCartney on a loop in my head and craving honey barbecue boneless wings with ranch from bdubs
If you're having doubts about Ant-Man, just go and see it, you won't be disappointed. He may not be a major character, but the movie is good
Looking forward to Monday Night Raw, the return of Brock Lesnar (and @HeymanHustle). #RAW
C'mon we all know Seth Rollins is going to win. #WWEchampionship #RAW

David Price is gonna be hellafun every 5th day.
Been on a huge Beatles binge since I heard Paul McCartney play this past Friday night. Even though I wasn't in the crowd, it was amazing.
Great day for baseball. David Price kills it in his debut for the Jays and then the Braves walk off in the 12th.  Love this game!!

Stats flying around lately, but this is my favourite: Today is the 2nd game where Troy Tulowitzki and David Price play for the Blue Jays.
I love "Bad Blood" and I love the music video, but it is just Taylor acting a damn fool. Like c'mon.
Thought about seeing the new Fantastic Four movie today. Passed and saw Ant-Man for a 2nd time instead. LOL #AntMan #FantasticFour
David Price is the 1st #BlueJays SP this season to record 8+ Ks in consecutive starts.
@smackalalala Currently 6-0 Top of the 9th. They got lucky trading for David Price.  That's one ace of a pitcher to have in the lineup.
@JimWebbUSA   - Carly Fiorina really came off very well in her 2nd tier Rep debate. Jim you need an opportunity to the same with the Dems

One of the advantages to living in SC is we get to meet candidates in person, going to meet Carly Fiorina tomorrow, a competent honest woman
Josh Hamilton may not be having a great year, but he's consistently delivered in crucial moments.
@thedoctor2016 @japancuriosity @MangaUK I hope that they attract the right audience and some that may not have seen DBZ or Naruto before.
Josh Hamilton can strike out 4 times but if bats in the 9th or later, he will win you the baseball game.
Reading The Hobbit, listening to Sam Smith, mom is cooking her mean Pork Nilaga. Steady Sunday it is. Good morning :)
Gonna wait until tomorrow to see Ant-Man and take my ma with me.

If you are a real MMA fan then UFC 194 will probably be the 2nd best card of the year I wouldn't put the Rousey card in the top 10
Seth Rollins promo has been better than the first two hours of Monday Night #RAW
Seth rollins would have been a great champion if he does all things whatever he says every monday night on #raw in the middle of this ring
John Cena just did more than Seth Rollins ever could to sell that match on Sunday. #SummerSlam #RAW
Brock Lesnar on ESPN tomorrow including @MikeAndMike and Sportscenter. Glad to see the Worldwide Leader embracing the "E" in ESPN and WWE.
Brock Lesnar on SportsCenter tomorrow morning. Wrasslin' is going mainstream again!
Tawney and I already have plans to go to dunkin tomorrow after I move in... the addiction is real.
I think it's fair to say that Brock Lesnar is winning this Sunday #raw @WrestlingInc
Brock Lesnar's the best thing going in wrestling.   There's not even a close 2nd.
When everyone's so excited about Lady A at the fair but you just saw The Zac Brown Band on Friday http://t.co/7cGqb9WPZ3
Haven't played ball in a while, definitely gotta go Ice Cube on a good day tomorrow at the gym.
That was a nice nod seeing Ice Cube writing the screenplay for FRIDAY. Another movie directed by F. Gary Gray.
I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/88Zz0T7tuI Arnold Schwarzenegger and Joe Manganiello join Hulk Hogan in the ring: Raw, March 24,
@JohnCena that was golden what you said to Seth Rollins on Monday Night Raw. Go Cena! 16X champion coming soon to you.
i know you beat seth rollins on this sunday...............beacause the real champ is here https://t.co/hYu9x3YWnk

Radio just played U2's "Bad". Which rarely happens &amp; is one of my very favorite songs of all time so my day may have just peaked very early.
Can't wait to go to @kidsfest with nirvana on Sunday. And for a great cause @jbmt1 .. Everyone should get down and show support
Rolling Stone and The Zone are the best songs on Thursday
Brock Lesnar on sportscenter talking about his fight with the Undertaker this Sunday.... What a time to be alive
They shud've skipped all the stuff abt the Chronic &amp; Ice Cube writing Friday &amp; skipped to them bcoming cool w/ Eazy. Other stuff irrelevant
Tuesday's off are the BEST cause I get to catch up on Big Brother, Bachelor in Paradise, and SYTYCD. #YAS
Ice Cube made his son a movie star. Now they should just do awhole new "Friday" with his son playing as him
John Kasich, a powder-blue Republican, perfect for the Sunday talk shows. https://t.co/MKQ2QBm3Ta

Feeling down this Monday? Check out this guy who dressed as baby Prince George for a week - it might cheer you up! http://t.co/PNwNBanIvr
I always thought Prince was the 18th best songwriter of all time but it's nice of Rolling Stone to confirm that.
1st match of the night is Randy Orton vs Sheamus. Sensible choice considering that Sheamus is the Money in the bank winner.

Crew gets a fumble at the 4, Murray and the O can't punch it in. Kick a FG to make it 17-7. May be Murray's team now. Crew has been awesome.
Assuming Murray pulls it out here all 4 matches on Monday will be very intriguing.
A lot has happened while I was away sprain-spraying my ankle. Murray has taken the 1st set 6-3 in 50 mins &amp; is up a break at 2-1 in the 2nd.
@OhApache well make sure they are good then we be gucci I may have one
Everywhere I go by Janet Jackson ! ugh I remember waking up when it was still dark in the winter for school I think like 3rd grade
@teamgabrod I like pumpkin muffins from Dunkin!  Would Thursday or Friday be good for you??
Murray d. Bellucci 6-3 6-2 7-5. Much better play from the start compared to his last match. Very tamed match. Into 4th round. #USOpen
@toastodilly may i have 'john cena' so i can use it as my center piece for my wall of john cena i will have in the near future

Kris Bryant absolutely mashed a HR. The only thing that held that ball in was the video board. Left fielder never turned around..1-1 Bot 5th
Also the band at the pub is making an OK-ish job out of the Foo Fighters so my Sunday night has been wrapped up in a weird, sweet kinda way.

@tonyredmen1 Hey Tony saw you in the pit at Foo Fighters on Saturday, but didn't have the chance to say hi! Did you have a good evening?
I will be oddly satisfied if the Red Sox can finish the season in 3rd place in the division.
#crosbynet Yoga every Saturday at Beach Lawn Garden 10-11am. Going to carry on outdoors every weekend until defeated by the weather! :)
Murray has decided to only hit Aces. Already 4 and it's just his 2nd game !!

@andy_murray knows how to wring my nerves! Talk about tension and it's only the 1st set :-) Brilliant stuff. Behind you all the way Murray!
you dont understand how excited i am for the foo fighters tomorrow!!   mother fuckin @foofighters   #foofighters   *whispers*  foo fighters
wait for the island show tomorrow is Shawn gonna be doing his full set or just some songs
Haha I'm going to see Foo Fighters tomorrow Jesus Christ that's just hit me
@DareToHart i'm not a huge fan myself but you know Murray will probably comeback in the 3rd &amp; 4th set knowing him.
Murray has this. He may not have it at the moment but I'm not worried #USOpen #murray
Idk if this is or not but shoutout the lil bro Lani for scoring the first TD last Friday night (sing Katy Perry... http://t.co/5XJC8oEAgM
@notzeev IKR, gonna be me tomorrow night "Hi Costco, Naruto ready for work, believe it!"
What an effort from Murray in that 2nd set. Got to take the momentum from the last few games into the 3rd. #USOpen
Thursday will mark Tom Brady's 14th consecutive opening day start, the largest active streak in the NFL! http://t.co/DcyQ7M9NKL
Piers Newbery : @piersnewbery:  Murray breaks back in the 3rd, huge roar, crowd loving it. Not sure Lamps expe...... http://t.co/HRAiTsXvzq
There you go! Murray breaks back in the 3rd. Can he make another comeback here? Looooong way to go! #USOpen2015 #@usopen
@Joannalangfield Concerned. If Murray can win this 3rd set, I think/hope he can win the match :)
Yoga tomorrow at 7:30 pm at Illuminate! I can't wait to see you guys there!
15-30 on Murray's serve, but the Scot more up than down finally and grabs the hold of serve with a couple of aces.  Andy up 4-3* 3rd set.
Really great match this now. Anderson is going for broke on every Murray 2nd serve, and Murray is winning most rally points now. #USOpen2015
Murray does well to hold. 5-4 to Murray. Anderson to serve to stay in the 3rd set #USOpen
Lets go Andy! Murray wins the 3rd set, down 1-2. #usopen #andymurray
Get in!! Murray take the 3rd!! (Anderson leads 7-6 6-3 6-7) #USOpen2015
But! Murray takes the tie break in the 3rd set and we've got GAME ON! http://t.co/tzKVTmQMkL
Come on @andy_murray!! Tempted to make my way across to Flushing Meadows on Wednesday if Murray comes back to win here! #USOpen
@SkySportsTennis it's why I love tennis. One minute looks like murray is down and out. Next minute anything is possible! C'mon @andy_murray
@serialsockthief Definitely although I think if Murray does enough to win the 4th set he'll go on and win it.
It may only be the round of 16, but holy cow! Don't tell that Anderson and Murray! Incredible match! 3hrs and 40min so far. #USOpen2015
This Murray vs Anderson match is great. 4 hour match and it's still in the 4th set.

New David Bowie tune to start Friday and its ten minutes long, good work David. A tour announcement now would make today perfect #Blackstar
@9_volt88 they need to move back to King's Field already. Good baby step. Just Dark Souls in 1st person with tweaks.
David Bowie's new song Blackstar is fucking brilliant. He is ceaselessly exceptional and innovative. Excited for the album January 8th!

I want Skye to be the love of May and Thor
@WpgHockTalk true, but I thought the 5 on 5 play was pretty even though well into the 3rd. You didn't? That Mighty Thor goal huge.
@OfIceAndBlood Owen grinned, this may be a little easier. "I've heard a lot about you from Thor and Chris. It's lovely to meet you!"
Dreamed I met David Bowie at a coffee shop. Got to talking about music and he sat down with me for hours. Hope it was prophetic.
23 November 1970. George Harrison released "My Sweet Lord" in the US. It would become the first single by a former Beatle to reach No.1
Thor will be with his new owners tomorrow.
@ClarkeMicah What did you say to Tony Blair to make him tell you to sit down and stop being bad, may I ask? Found it funny, is all.
THOR has always been a GREAT seller for us! But it is the 4th Thor #1 in the last couple of years, right? (including THORS)
Tomorrow we play the new David Bowie song to start the program at 3pm on Your Tuesday Afternoon Alternative - join us for #YTAA on #WUDR
Dark Souls was a ton of fun tonight. I'm going to continue again on Wednesday.
It's may sound an odd choice, but if I could bring back one musician for one concert, it would be George Harrison.
we may not have the civil trailer but we're gonna get rdj and chris evans on jimmy kimmel. and this is pure happiness.
Okay so Chris Evans and RDJ will be on Jimmy Kimmel tonight and if tomorrow I wake up to a Civil War teaser I will lose all my chill
I can't wait for the Diamond Is Unbreakable anime in April, looking forward to seeing "anime David Bowie" get a raging hard on for hands

THE HOBBIT TRILOGY may have been flawed, but Ian McKellan and Cate Blanchett are friends now, so it was all worth it.

We're looking forward to hearing the result together - 12.30pm Friday at Thor's Tipi on Parliament St - find out with us!
They may laugh at Rahul Gandhi, but the laughter is starting to sound just a wee bit artificial, slowly and surely he is coming back.
