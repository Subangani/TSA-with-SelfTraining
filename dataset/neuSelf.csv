Given that Watchman repeats passages whole, it seems Lee didn't want to publish a 2nd book so much as she wanted to correct Mockingbird.

Surely everyone has heard of the "Paul Dunne vs rules official" on the 18th green in Statesborough story.  #worldwar3
Hope Paul Dunne's boss lets him have tomorrow off for the final round. #TheOpen
Paul Dunne may be an amateur, but he is a co-leader at #TheOpen and is older than his fellow co-leader, Jordan Spieth.
Would the bigger story be 3rd straight major for @JordanSpieth or win by an am from Ireland, Paul Dunne, @dunners11? Hmmm
Jordan Spieth finishes the round at -6, is currently tied for 2nd with Paul Dunne and Jason Day (all -11) at The Open.
Paul Dunne may be the solo leader very soon....
@BrianDietzen paul dunne is leading by one shot and he is an amateur. Will he pick claret jug tomorrow?
When Paul Dunne made his 3 wishes, perhaps he should have been more specific than "#1 Be leading up the 18th on Sunday at The Open" #bbcgolf
Heading to the 18th amateur Paul Dunne still has a share of #TheOpen lead.   Live: http://t.co/NI1sjtGRxI http://t.co/6YqMvqsa8D
Paul Dunne is suddenly British! @BBCSport @tarMAKbert If he loses tomorrow he'll probably be Irish again no doubt. #TheOpen2015
It's every golfers dream to walk the 18th at St Andrews on Sunday leading #theopen Just a shame for Paul Dunne the final round is tomorrow
Paul Dunne posts 6-under 66 and he'll have some serious Francis Ouimet undertones going on during tomorrow's final round.
Paul Dunne at -12, very possible that he'll be tied for the lead heading into tomorrow.
Paul Dunne looked embarrassed after that round and to be at the top of the leaderboard as an amateur! Good luck for tomorrow! #TheOpen2015

Tom Rinaldi didn't want to end his interview with Paul Dunne until Dunne was properly intimidated by tomorrow. Way to drive it home Tom.

When you realise Paper Towns is out tomorrow http://t.co/bYCibL6SYK
All I see over my Twitter feed is "Paper Towns is out tomorrow" i realised this 50 tweets ago, thank you.
Dustin Johnson's caddie should do the old hockey trick where every Sunday he tells him it's Thursday all morning so he shoots mid-60s.
Dustin Johnson hacking about. It must be a Sunday.
So much for coming from behind being better for Dustin Johnson. He's done and he hasn't gotten to the 1st green yet.
Dustin Johnson cashing it in on the 1st hole. That didn't take long.
Quality start for Dustin Johnson with an 8. He apparently is not a fan of Sunday golf. #PGAChampionship
Dustin Johnson...the 1st hole? Wow...#PGAChampionship
@SPeetGolfEast @JamesKent85 Hate to see it. Dustin Johnson on the 1st. #headsgone
At least Dustin Johnson didn't hang around til the end to lose this major..i think he's hitting his 7th shot on 1st hole. Still not on green
Not sure I could muster the mental strength to play 17 more holes after  doing what Dustin Johnson just did on the 1st. #PGAChampionship
Dustin Johnson quadruple bogies the 1st hole? Must be Sunday of a major
Is there really any point in Dustin Johnson playing the 4th round of a major?
Poor Dustin Johnson! This is going to be special. C'mon Rose #PGAChampionship
Dustin Johnson runs out of coke by the 4th round
Apparently Paper Towns is out tomorrow, in case you didn't quite get the memo..
Dustin Johnson has blew it. Quadruple bogie at the 1st
Owl Dustin johnson always gets himself into contention. Then goes on a coke binge come the saturday night, and then totally blows up.
You can't make this up. Dustin Johnson starts his round with a snowman 8 quadruple boget on the 1st.
@capnryan Hey Ryan! Would you consider having on Audrey Middleton from CBS's Big Brother? She made history being the 1st transgender on it!
@LBC @NickFerrariLBC talking about Muslims tomorrow morning? Are you sure it's the right show??
Who's going to Sam Smith's concert tomorrow??
Super Eagles coach, Sunday Oliseh says it is wrong to tag some players 'home-based,' even as they ply their trade in the domestic league.
If you stare directly at the sun, it merely burns your retinas. If you stare directly at Chuck Norris, you die.
Frank Gifford past away 08/09/15. Helping to light up the camaraderie on Monday nights was only a part of what he'll be remembered (next
Dustin Johnson would have several majors under his belt if only the Thursday / Friday rounds counted
It didn't take long for Dustin Johnson to have his Sunday meltdown at the PGA: http://t.co/Llzgt6n4uE http://t.co/U3d9zXRyhK
Dustin Johnson would be -13, tied for 5th if he simply bogeyed the first instead of puttin' up a snowman.
Heck of a bounce back by Dustin Johnson to be under par after an 8 on the 1st #PGAChampionship #WhatCouldHaveBeen
I think if I wake up one day and realize that I am not married to Frank Ocean I may lose my mind.
...I KNOW the sexy pick for NL ROTY is Kris Bryant .257/16/66 1st rd., but Matt Duffy? .310/10/59 18th rd. ...Duffy has more hits overall...
Not often when you see Dustin Johnson going low on a Sunday
If Dustin Johnson had pared the 1st hole he'd be 17 under right now
Dustin Johnson's scorecard is ridiculous. Starts with a snowman on the 1st hole. Since then hes added 2 eagles and 4 birdies
WTF!!! Frank Ocean's album has been out since June 30th and I'm just finding out!!! How??????
Dustin Johnson is -8 over the last 14 holes.  Oh for that quad on the 1st....
Kudos to Dustin Johnson for finishing with a 69 after starting the day with a quadruple bogey. An 8 on the 1st could've led to an 80+ easy.
@highoffHAZEE only thing that is guaranteed of tomorrow is the finishing off of any Christians left in the M.E...Hazel wallah you're giving
Just your typical Sunday ...Spieth and Day there in the end, while Dustin Johnson falls apart in his final round
Ryan Braun hit a grand slam and finished with five RBI in Sunday's 6-1 win over the Phillies.
Dustin Johnson flies out of the blocks at every major, but he simply cannot get it right on a Sunday.
Anyone want to see Sam smith with me on October 6th?

Randy Orton and Sheamus wrestling for the 12th time in 3 years. Hopefully make it a 12th mediocre match in a row.
Didn't Randy Orton defeated Sheamus last time they were on a PPV? If so, then Sheamus may pull the victory. #SummerSlam
Randy Orton may have lost, but we all know he will get his revenge soon enough. #SummerSlam

Will John Cena tie Ric Flair tonight by winning his 16th world title? #SummerSlam
Surely they didn't make John Cena a 15x Champion shirt just so he could win a 16th.
Seth Rollins...White Power Ranger or 6th member of Backstreet Boys in I want it that way video
Title for Title match, winner take all, will it be Seth Rollins or will John Cena become 16th time World Champ &amp; tie Ric Flair?! #SummerSlam
Seth Rollins coming out here looking like the unmasked 6th Power Ranger. #SummerSlam
It's winner take all between John Cena and Seth Rollins. May the best wrestler win. #TitleForTitle #SummerSlam
John Cena may be the only man alive who still rocks cargo shorts. #TitleforTitle #SummerSlam
Seth Rollins looking like the 4th member of The New Day. I wonder what @WWEBigE @XavierWoodsPhD @TrueKofi #NewDayRocks #SummerSlam
I'm pretty sure Seth Rollins is heading out to a Saturday Night Fever themed party after the match #SummerSlam
Internet Wrestling Community nearly had a heart attack at the idea of John Cena winning 16th title with the figure four. #SummerSlam
That was stupid by John Stewart but who cares Seth Rollins is now the 1st man to hold WWE title &amp; US title together #SummerSlam
John Stewart, assists Seth Rollins for the win over Cena in an angle that will be poorly executed this Monday night on #RAW #SummerSlam
Either a Sheamus cash in tomorrow or Seth Rollins should give someone the U.S title #SummerSlam
So, Seth Rollins wins the U.S. Title just to vacate it tomorrow? #SummerSlam

Tomorrow at work, when people talk to me, I'm just going to slap my crotch and twerk in response. See if I get the same reaction Nicki did.
Taylor told Nicki weeks ago she can come on stage if she wins an award &amp; Nicki was "nah bitch ima bring you on stage so I can do it 1st"
Nicki may look Hollywood, but you hear every bit of New York when she opens her mouth.
Y'all was gna be mad at Nicki anyway. She just stole all the headlines for tomorrow, keep fuming bitches! New Queen of the VMA's.
Nicki is gonna open with trini dem girls on the pinkprint tour in south africa on the 2nd leg
can some1 pls tell me the name of the 1st song Nicki performed
Part of me thinks Nicki is so serious about her attitude towards Miley tho. She may be cool with her but she was a little serious. #VMAs
Miley better pick up the Hannah Montana wig again because that may be the only she'll hide from Nicki. #VMAs2015
I want Nicki to fight Miley on a national awards show so bad and tonight may be the night
Literally 1st time I've ever watched the #VMAs. Miley called Nicki out on her CRAP, and I respect that. #sorrynotsorry #suckitupnicki
Nicki &amp; Tay may be friends but I'm still not a fan like was Nicki for real about Miley this is too much for my emotions Im so confused #VMAs
Stop it Nicki said all that behind a smile https://t.co/VdEWp6aRLe
@Iovemyths Watch: even tho that was Nicki responding 2 Miley putting her on blast 1st the media will make it out like Nicki picking a fight.
I'm Team Nicki but I would never openly say something bad about Taylor Swift because I think she may have snipers on retainer.
my mom stood up to congratulate Nicki then she sat down when she heard Taylor LMAO
Basically my Sunday-Monday transition   "@en_jajaja: Nicki: thank you to my pastor Nicki: SO BITCH YOU WAS TALKIN MAD SHIT WHAT UP W THAT"

#seniorquote "I don't know about today, I don't know about tomorrow, but just do how you feel at the time" - Kanye West, a true intellectual
I'm leaving for Milan tomorrow, and realizing I should be sleeping cuz it's 5am there rn, and still night here.....
Kanye West to do list: -become a legendary rapper/icon -run for president -take over the world -resurrect on the 3rd day
Kanye West may be a lot of things. But lazy and unintelligent aren't in that category. He knows what he's doing.
Kanye West just announced he's running for president. Tomorrow his ego will be announced as his running mate
Kim may have broken the Internet with her body...but Kanye West just broke Twitter with his speech. #KanyeForPresident2020 #VMAs
only going to school tomorrow because nicki told me to...
taylor may have won against nicki and bey but she did fart on live tv so i think nicki and bey are the real winners
No really Nicki may have been the only black female artist we saw tonight
Imagine if you sat next to Caitlyn Jenner at like a restaurant .... I'd die
When y'all can write lyrics that come close to Tupac, Ice Cube, or Eminem then and only then you may get my attention
So basically tomorrow Nicki gonna beat Miley's ass, Bieber gonna get a hair cut, and Kanye's campaign posters are going up everywhere #VMAs
I start school tomorrow and I'm here watching Kanye rant, Miley and Nicki go at it and Tori Kelly blow the roof out of the #VMAs
Final thought: at some point Kanye West sat down his wife Kim Kardashian and said he wanted to run for president. What a time to be alive...
Yall act like Nicki really Finna mess up Taylor's moment ............for the 2nd time again. #VMAs
Everybody worried about Kanye west running for president in 5 years but I still don't know what I'm eating for breakfast tomorrow
I feel like I'm in 3rd grade again watching the VMAs.   Kanye is to Trump as Nicki is to Miley.
They girls still didn't get a selfie with Nicki n I was actually hoping for that more than the award. May the manips continue to rise smh

3 unforced errors for Andy Murray against 17 forAnderson yet Murray chucks away the 1st set with a careless double fault in the tie break.
I'm afraid of Murray though... He beat Belluci with ease in the 3rd round. Kevin's strong point is his serves!
Rare i walk away from a match but big day tomorrow so i need my sleep. Shout loud Murray fans #BacktheBrits #USOpen
Anderson now has the confidence to take rips at the Murray 2nd serve. Time to take off a few mph and up the first serve percentage Andrew
Can't believe what's her face, prince George's mum, is pregnant for the 3rd time
It may just be me focusing on the losses, but Murray's tie-break record seems shite in my head, in big games at least.
Come on Murray dig deep...I'm going to be tired for work tomorrow if I have to stay up for a 5-setter @SkySportsTennis
Looks like Murray is gonna have to do it the hard way again! 1 set down, 3-1 in the 2nd set! #ustennisopen
Anderson's 1st serve goes off in that game but Murray cant take advantage. Anderson now leads 4-1 in the 2nd set #USOpen

@UltimateTennis_ he better close it in 3, not making much 1st serves and Murray seems winning all 2nd serves..important serve game to start?
Anderson survives a test, and now has 2 sets up on Murray. Can the Brit pull off a 2nd 0-2 set comeback?
Murray about to get sent home. That ranking means nothing man, 15th vs 1st and you would never know...#usopen2015

Anderson is up 2 sets, but Murray is up a break in the 3rd set. It feels even-steven right now.
Although it's hard to tell, since I only have radio commentary. May just be that Anderson is choking badly, not Murray playing better.
Murray gets a warning for racquet abuse then proceeds to give his racquet to someone in the crowd. Anderson breaks back for *2-3 in the 3rd.

Thor just giving me my 16th heart attack of the night. It's okay, just some candy corn lodged in my valves this time. #LGM
Thor said Thursday during press conf that he had tricks up his sleeve for tonight. It was the Warthen slider, he relied on it heavily 3 IP+
Harold Reynolds talking how the 1st pitch from Thor sent a message, sure if you forget the Royals he 6 hits in the first 2 innings
how about the balls on TC to stay with Thor with bases loaded to get that 3rd out!! #mets

@good @EmilyKnits @utopianpath Those are pictures from the Charlie Hebdo rallies in January, guys.
This may be the tiniest act of defiance, but I just downloaded 2-Eagles of Death Metal songs on iTunes &amp; I'd subscribe to Charlie Hebdo too
@TheyCallMePansy The tweet is from January, during the Charlie Hebdo crisis.
(yo, that Trump gun control tweet circulating is from January, just after the Charlie Hebdo attack)
@bfp1974 @therealcliffyb January 7th was the date of the last terrorist attack in Paris on the Charlie Hebdo magazine.
@ashalynd Apparently Trump (may have) made this comment back during the Charlie Hebdo attack and not this one.
@marthamaccallum I keep remembering idea in January that Charlie Hebdo attack, a fraction of the scale of this, might be a "game changer."
@Nick468official That picture - was a gathering after the Charlie Hebdo attacks from January.
in this pic Dana White is either immensely proud of his fighters or a creepy perv and I'm not sure which one it is https://t.co/QvezA6StOi
@Flowerchic462 it's from a rally after the Charlie Hebdo shooting in January. Not technically "fake" but not from tonight.
This is from the Charlie Hebdo attack back in January. Yes it's a beautiful image, but this isn't current. https://t.co/1ykOz58AJz
I would be cautious saying all terrorists are dead remember Charlie Hebdo, a few came out the next day while they were looking for the 1st 2
Not even a year after the Charlie Hebdo attack (Jan 2015).
he Charlie Hebdo shooting from January and the situation right now are 2 separate events. get it right.
Attn: that "not afraid" group shot in Paris is NOT from tonight... that's from after Charlie Hebdo in January... sigh, social media.
@Tamschi_ @CathyYoung63 I know it's from Charlie Hebdo, i know that they won't march now, it's a sentiment, that's all.
@Uber_Pix That photo was taken on January 7th of this year, shortly after the attack on Charlie Hebdo. Don't spread misinformation.
@ITNlive : Prashant Kishore may be a Chanakya but not capable enough 2 make a leader like Rahul Gandhi the PM of this  great country.
Sure the Trump tweet was in January, but it is still relevant because it was about Charlie Hebdo.
Before we were all Charlie Hebdo, now we are all Parisian - tomorrow we may have to identify with others, but we must not be intimidated
I know it doesn't negate his utter twatishness but that Donald Trump tweet was after the Charlie Hebdo attack in January not last night
I was part of an anti-war march that the media quoted roughly half the attendance figures and the rest.....well that was over to Tony Blair.
Shows how little people paid attn to the Charlie Hebdo stuff 11mo ago when they're tweeting the pic of people in the streets from January.

@lesleyabravanel @graceheIps May I just point out that even though DT's tweet was horrendous, it was after Charlie Hebdo on January 7th
@UFCEurope @maizing2 dana white said may getva rematch in ufc 200 rousey thought she wanted 2 finish ongoing projects.
