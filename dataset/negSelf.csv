Go figure on Miss USA is talking about bi racial and 1st time immigrants sad how the owner missed up the girls this yr.
Also just now starting Miss USA so nobody text me about top 5 who wins etc Bc I may kill u

Man behind 5th-grade insults in @RollingStone hot take a "senior editor" ... which explains a lot about Rolling Stone http://t.co/7rGAm1ju86
Then you add in the guilt factor. Did Harper Lee really want Watchman published? If her 1st draft has been hijacked I'd feel bad reading it.
New TV series BBC2 1950h Sunday called 'Smug rich buggers make poorer people beg' I bet George Osborne absolutely loves it
Completely agree. Rolling stone is Such a sell out! Fuck it, you may as well put Paris Hilton on there http://t.co/TaETO1OzBp
Still can't believe Ryan Braun and Jew Unit were able to beat the 1st test on technicality that his piss was mishandled!
Hearing that #ToKillAMockingbird and #GoSetAWatchman have identical passages gives more reason not to read it... Watchman is a 1st draft!

I haven't even officially started working at Dunkin yet and I already don't want to go in tomorrow lol
Boko Haram are so evil. Even on this sacred day for all muslims, they are carrying out bombings. May the hottest part in hell be for them
Horrendous, may their souls rest in peace, I hope the govt redoubles their efforts to wipe out Boko Haram. http://t.co/swGOjc44I7

@SamEades only because Iron Maiden sat across from us kept looking at me like he wanted to kill me with his awful bare hands.
Paul Dunne with a birdie putt on the 12th hole and just misses it. Very unlucky. Stays in a share of the lead at -11 with Spieth #TheOpen
I hope Paul Dunne blows up tomorrow only because UAB beats us in the tourney... #stillnotoverit
If you aren't rooting for Paul Dunne tomorrow in The Open you:   A.  Are not Irish B.  Have no soul
@notthefakeSVP  who was the dork asking Paul Dunne what will be your thought in the first tee tomorrow. What a stupid question that was
Whether it's the 3rd round or 4th round Dustin Johnson just doesn't like Sunday's in majors!!
Looking at today's play at the #OpenChampionship You can't define Dustin Johnson's round as anything other than a choke. Tied for 2nd worst
Must be the worse golfer of all time Irish Amature Paul Dunne teed off 6.43am Thursday scheduled to finish around 7.15pm on Monday!!!
Saw it late but Carlos Gomez may have passed Ryan Braun in most hated baseball players

@BBCSport I feel sorry for Paul Dunne! If he keeps playing the way  hes playing he'll be British by tomorrow evening!! #rockonrockall
Apparently it's not just the final round that makes Dustin Johnson choke it's just Sunday.
@David_Cameron wonder if Bukhari thinks the Muslim patrols in East London, the actions of ISIL, al Qaeda and Boko Haram ALL Muslim  may have
There's nothing as 3rd day of Eid, relatives. Just don't. Just don't even think about coming to our house. GO EAT ELSEWHERE
Okay, so I may have known some of the sht that happened in Kpop but I guess I went on hiatus because everything was negative and in turn...
R&amp;A's handling of the end of round 2 was diabolical. I watched Spieth, Matsuyama and Dustin Johnson early Saturday, very unfair on them.
'3rd Day of Eid ul fitar Of 2012'.. that was the Worst day ever of me... !! &amp; this day always remember as Black Day in my Life..  #BlackDay
@Ezraile I am confused you said you were praying Eid wouldn't be tomorrow.
Not a great start for the amateur Paul Dunne. Imagine having to compose yourself to hit your third ball (5th shot) off the tee on hole 2!
Who was the idiot pundit on BBC Scotland on Saturday who "couldn't see past Dustin Johnson" for The Open and why are they paying him?
Paul Dunne currently regretting the deal he struck with Satan to finish Sunday in first place. #open2015

Dustin Johnson led the British Open at the halfway stage at St Andrews on Saturday on a day that saw one of the worst wind delays in the
Sharknado 3 Oh Hell No, is that the movies title or just everyone's reaction when they heard a 3rd one was being churned out?
I wish I was excited right now for Sharknado 3. But I'm not. I'll catch it later on today, or tomorrow on my DVR.
I'm gonna watch Sharknado 3 cause I have no tv shows to watch on a Wednesday not cause I enjoy it.
Sorry I can't make it in to work tomorrow got caught in a SHARKNADO
Sharknado is the silliest film franchise so badly produced I cudnt stop laughing through the 2nd, I saw sharks flying n had to call it a day
may i just say the lighting in Sharknado 3 could use a little work?????
I don't even understand how Sharknado is even a thing, let alone having a 3rd movie. The SE suck, the acting sucks, and it's so dumb I laugh
@yuu_naoyuki this is the 3rd one. Check Sharknado and Sharknado 2 too. XD it's horrible that it's hilarious. This is a really bad movie.
So wait, Twitter decides if April lives or dies? It doesn't make sense... But then my husband reminded me this is Sharknado. #Sharknado3
@MattFossen @FrankConniff 1st, they did do Plan 9. 2nd, Sharknado is not earnestly bad, it's ironically so. That's why MST3K wouldn't work
I am not in the right frame of mind to attempt to watch Sharknado 3 yet. I may need to start drinking.
A 60 mile flame burning hotter than the surface of the sun!?!  Come on Sharknado, that is even ridiculous for you.
I may not be much in this world, but I'll never be as awful as a 21-year-old who acts like they enjoy the musical stylings of Nirvana.
I'm emotional calibraska is tomorrow and I can't get it ughhhh h8 life
Who knew there were enough people in the world easily pleased by shite like Sharknado that they're getting a 4th instalment?!
The fact that there is a 3rd Sharknado is everything that is wrong with this world...   Lamer than my #LameJoke collection...   #Sharknado3
It may be gloomy today but that doesn't stop National Hot Dog Day to be placed on hold! Stop by the Leasing Office to enjoy some franks!
all the jack and jack girls ain't gonna have no chill when calibraska comes out tomorrow.
@ShabzRehman an Egyptian source which only says it's considered false. There have been videos also perpetuating Friday's Eid as wrong.
It sucks we live in a world where Sharknado is about to start a 4th sequel but we can't get a Tron 3 or Dredd 2.
I hate the Sharknado fandom. It's a poor imitation of so bad it's good. Also I  don't care if April lives #suckmynado
In other news why the hell is tomorrow National Hot Dog Day....I don't even like hot dogs like that
@PeterD_1996 @BBCBreaking Dear Peter, trust me.... We know you mean well...btw Boko Haram, Food, Power, Education, Hospitals....C'mon

Just a quick note- Hulk Hogan was a bad wrestler anyway. C'mon now, the leg drop? Give me a break.  Back to real sports- Go Yankees!
Dress up like Hulk Hogan on #WWERaw Monday and then security will usher you to a room and make you watch #TheMarine4. #WWE   Use your head.
Josh Hamilton rejoined the Rangers n an effort to overcome his struggle w/ addiction. Angels fans just booed him in 1st game back. #pathetic
Sharknado may be the worst movie ever created
Liberals supporting Yakub today are the same guys who will support ISIS tomorrow..
Where vanished "candle brigade" which used to march on every terror attack, demanding justice? Wud U march with candles to "HANG" Yakub?
I can't believe this is the 1st time Hulk Hogan has been called out for making a fool of himself. Anyone else notice that guy's entire life?
@abpnewstv why ABP is telecasting Yakub family interview.  It is to get the sympathy.  ABP may be hanged along with YAKUB
At the heart of the Boko Haram is the huge issue of poverty. These people have no reason to want to live till tomorrow. -#Oshiomhole #Edo

They killed the AMERICAN DREAM dusty Rhodes   Now they taking the American hero Hulk Hogan.   The people's champ may be next
@BeingSalmanKhan r you drunk?how is yakub innocent?1st time dissapointed by you
Yakub will be hanged on July 30 anyway! So Why tweet in his support now? Nothing to do with his movie running in theatres. Eh, Bhaijaan?
Many feared dead as a bomb blast rocks the crowded Sunday market in Damaturu. Boko Haram shall be defeated
Yakub funded 1993 bomb blast, so he is a criminal, but wht bhai said is hang tiger 1st who was d master mind of d blast! #SalmanStandsClear
Salman's views in favour of Yakub can be usedby prosecution in hit n run case tp prove him not a law abiding citizen,it may cost him dearly
With the way Boko Haram is going and PMB 's response, we may have more casualties by the end of his tenure.
#SalmanBeingIgnorant Yakub's hanging may be shadowy but what concern is the people who actually planted the bomb got less punishment
Bhai jaan@BeingSalmanKhan it was not unintentionally u clrly mention Yakub is innocent may be ur driving it was night time u know@MrsGandhi
I think Sharknado 3 may have jumped the shark, and gone too far down the make a bad movie road. The second half is just awful in a bad way.

People seeking mercy for Yakub, Hope this Punjab terror attack may jolt you out of stupidity into reality #Gurdaspur
Regarding his Twitter, Hulk Hogan is not doing himself any favors by saying anything w/o running it through a good p.r. team and lawyer 1st.
no matter 40,40k,40 lac people sign the mercy petition of Yakub,he will be hung on 30th.no change in order.
Misleading headline. But may this divided ANC-house soon fall. -&gt; 'Boko Haram' make a bid for Limpopo http://t.co/mYzuIp0hIB
@NaseerudinShah u supported Yakub.  Have guts to Show solidarity with #GurdaspurAttack victims ?  Remember cockroach from Wednesday?
The Hulk Hogan story effectively ended by Friday afternoon. Instead of disappearing, Hogan going on defensive retweet spree. Bad PR move.
@kelly_welles if you haven't seen Hulk Hogan's twitter feed yet... it may be a display of a bad week getting even worse...
Hulk Hogan won't have a good day tomorrow when he realises everyone has been treating him like a world class cunt
#YakubDebate   Gurdaspur terror attack is likely turn the public opinion against Yakub who may not get any relief from any quarter now.

@narendramodi Citizens are confused on Yakub undoubtedly he is a traitor and 2nd is he is traitor turned informer .... let RAW win.
@dmnqpvt Hartzel and I are planning to watch Ant-Man tomorrow at SM Pala-pala but the problem is that it's only available in 3D
It has become a wrong trend to protect the person who has been punished by SC &amp; President,without any 2nd thought Yakub be hanged#YakubDebat
I think Tushar Gandhi should hang himself to protest against hanging of Yakub.And yes it should be on 29th just day B4 30th #yakubdebate

Ant-Man tomorrow. Looking forward to it, but some asshole ruined it for me.
Very bad idea 2 allow the dead body of Yakub to come to Mumbai-situation may become evn more tense @Dev_Fadnavis @HMOIndia @BJPRajnathSingh
if Yakub had faith in Indian Judicial System that he came back, why did he blow up people in Mar-93 as justice for riot victims?
@mihirssharma Hey fucker! Cry as much u want.Ur "bother" Yakub is going to be hang tomorrow.Suck it bitch.
@brownbrumby Agree with 2nd part,but Yakub is no reason. Best logical argument against his hanging by @Raghav_Bahl. @YRDeshmukh @asadowaisi
@Flipkart @MotorolaIndia Flipkart isn't letting me exchange my Moto G 2nd gen mobile. They are cancelling my orders. You just lost a buyer.
Yakub death may be unfortunate bt we shud respect SC's decision n not vitiate atmosphere in the name of religion #YakubToHang #YakubVerdict
Hulk Hogan. More like Bulk Fooligan. Some folks never know when it's time to leave the room. He's had his day in the sun. Time to go away!

@SappyReDevil Yakub has to be hanged and he will definitely be hanged at 7 am tomorrow morning. Birthday = death day.

Pranab Mukherjee has just again rejected Yakub's 2nd mercy petition, hanging would be on as per schedule at 7am tomorrow #HangYakubNow .
Still not clear whether Yakub will be hanged Thursday! One more challenge to his death sentence in the SC
Why is Stone Cold on the cover of #WWE2K16? He's hardly ever on anymore. Seth Rollins would be better. This may declare a no buy for me!
If something wrong happen tomorrow due to Yakub death sentence, media should be blame for it. They r making it more sensitive. #YakubToHang
@tajinderbagga No issues if he is saving an innocent of any religion, but Yakub killed hundreds of innocent, tomo Bhushan may back ISIS too!

@D_J_Harvey I think they may want a guy with back problems. Here, have Ryan Braun!
Yakub may or may not hav deseved death but he definitely deservd life imprisonment 4his deeds.Shame on those who are painting him as a saint

@iamyawar The 1st two reacted 2 the burning alive of 59 Hindus by Muslims in a train. Can u tell me how Muslims will react if burnt alive?
Trying to keep up with Scott Walker's position on the issue of the 14th Amendment is about as easy as herding cats. http://t.co/SVG997N40U
Well with Zayn joining ISIS it is hard to maintain their family friendly image. https://t.co/ObzEtFCpPg
Why would the sun publish such a big announcement of 1D splitting up and not like what they did with Zayn on FB?
The Sun is bullshit 99% of the time but they're the ones who said Louis is gonna be a dad and Zayn left and look what happened
Why does Big Brother still exist? Well, it's on Channel 5, which some may consider a fate worse than cancellation.
Changed my field hockey number from 5 to 4 bc Zayn left but if the unthinkable happens this March I guess I'm gonna be number 0
Remember! original Christians of USA choked the food &amp; water supplies of the pagans to make them toe the line http://t.co/FdFdh5eKza
@honestfandom The sun is shit in general! they made up bad thing about Zayn, the baby news, Harry and 'X' girl every day, homophobic Liam

@JohnCena @WWERollins it wasn't a fair fight, it just proves that Seth Rollins can't win a title w/o someone taking his opponent down 1st!
@GaetaSusan Exactly. No difference between the koran #ISIS uses,or the #koran the "peaceful" Muslims we may think we know,at work/school...
Try as I may, I just can't get excited for Celebrity Big Brother or standard version. It needs a break for s few years #cbb #BigBrother17
'Last Friday Night' does not depict a healthy relationship with intoxicants. do not invite Katy Perry to your parties

White feminism will be all over the newspapers tomorrow saying how Nicki attacked Miley. That's you call someone out!!!!
If Kanye West comes even close to winning the 2020 election, like 5th place or higher, I'm leaving the country for Canada

I hate you Kanye West and if you become president u may be assassinated, I hope
Scott Walker thinks building a wall between the US &amp; anything is legitimate. His Wall dreams will cost taxpayers an arm, leg &amp; 1st born.

Christians may act like the world because they are ignorant of who they are!   http://t.co/3uQEXvUtHC http://t.co/wMbqCfagSj
Nicki is always feuding with somebody. Lil Kim, Mariah Carey, Iggy Azalea, Taylor Swift, now Miley Cyrus... I like her but c'mon
I'm a bit annoyed about what miley said about nicki. Taylor started the pop star against pop star war, nicki didn't even sat her name
Why don't you let Carly Fiorina debate? She's tough and smart and has ranked 5th in most polls. What a waste of ratings!!!
Kanye West struggling through this speech is like watching a four year old learn how to read. "It's ok, baby, you can try again tomorrow."
I may be late.. But Kanye West just wasted 10 mins of my life ill never get back with the STUPIDEST speech known to man...wow lol

No way Kane comes here, it's where he gets in trouble the most. Would be kicked out of the NHL by his 30th bday for summer incidents

Murray's serve broken in 1st service game 2nd set. I'm not watching any more. He does my  head in at times doing everything the hard way!
@SkySportsTennis Murray's career is characterised by a pathetic 2nd serve and an unwillingness to be offensive unless he's playing Djokovic
If Murray loses this 2nd set I'm pretty sure he won't win this.
soooo jealous of everyone going to the Ed Sheeran concert tomorrow
Woeful start to the 3rd from Murray. Think this is lights out for him.
Murray always struggles on Louis Armstrong. How pivotal was that person disrupting his serve causing him to  lose his mini break in the 1st?
Murray about as dead as the aliens in Independence Day on July 4th in #America. They die in the movie either way but worse on the 4th. #Dead
I'm sad I feel like I'm going to get bad seats tomorrow with my luck &amp; idk if z100 called the ppl for who's going to sit on stage for shawn
Murray misses a good chance to break at the start of the 4th. Sloppy along with a brilliant shot from Anderson denies the break. #USOpen
With school starting tomorrow I'm gonna be missing out on so much with Zayn this makes me so sad
Murray blew it! Just couldn't handle Anderson's first serve in the 4th set.
@maxcouch @roryjiwani @Alex_0wen @DanBarberTF @Tennisratings Murray will never win a slam again unless he changes. 2nd serve a joke

Fine margins in tennis. I think if Murray had won that 1st set tie-break, he'd be preparing for the q/f. Disappointing end to slam season.

I hope Tony Blair feels shit standing there at Remembrance Sunday, cause he's partly to blame for the deaths or so many soldiers in Iraq
How can Tony Blair get invited at 'Remembrance' Sunday and there was no invite for the Merchant Navy by David Cameron ? 'Disgusting'!
On Remembrance Sunday my primary thought is of this very day in 1987-when the IRA tried 2 murder members of my family for daring to remember
Tony Blair may be responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, but at least he bowed low enough, eh? #RemembranceSunday

@aliceraee the Charlie Hebdo killers were French, so there's a high possibility these are French too. May as well just shoot everyone...
@ChemiShalev @ghoshworld it's certainly tasteless and horrible, but this tweet is from Jan 7, right after Charlie Hebdo shooting
@MxJackMonroe @realDonaldTrump Tweeted January at time of Charlie Hebdo - stupid then (&amp; now) but not tweeted tonight.
So that Trump tweet making the rounds right now is a response to the Charlie Hebdo attack back in January, not today's tragedy.

@Polygon no less ridiculous than ANY of the THOR movies by Marvel. Or Melinda May beating up any guy on Agents of SHIELD
@Ashtopher they haven't do that right after the February attacks, against Charlie Hebdo do you remember ?
And I thought he was a relativist. "Kerry sees 'rationale' in Charlie Hebdo murders, unlike Friday's attacks in Paris"
So John Kerry said this today and Saturday I asked why no outrage over the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack: they deserved it?
This is the legacy of Tony Blair and George Bush. Intervention only seen as a plaster, not a permanent fix.  https://t.co/eOpteh0ecq
Kerry can see the rationale behind the Charlie Hebdo attack. Fairly disgusting  https://t.co/Q7jCYU7lBw
Dana White is a terrible promoter sometimes. Instead of praising Holm her for her performance, he says Rousey had a bad night? C'mon man.
Prithviraj Chauhan defeated Ghori 2 times and left him alive.but the 3th time Ghori killed him. Rahul Gandhi caught 2 times by NDA . 3rd ?

@mePadraigReidy @EllieCumbo Part of me suspects Corbyn may march on his own party HQ with STW &amp; blame it on Tony Blair. You never know.
@Ed_Bradshaw @GamesnClass no the IRA grew out of oppression &amp; internment &amp; Bloody Sunday &amp; Ballymurphy &amp; kids killed by rubber bullets &amp;
@DPJHodges But the point is that Corbyn's sympathy for IRA is not relevant in deciding whether to vote same way as him tomorrow
@edmendsfahey1 Curtis Good isn't good enough for the Scottish 2nd Division mate - another terrible buy to go with all of the rest.
The biggest victory for the IRA was Bloody Sunday. Membership surged. Bombing Syria will only do the same. Membership of ISIS will rocket.

Bloody Sunday was the IRA's biggest recruitment driver during The Troubles. Bombing Syria is bound to have the same effect I'd have thought

This may be an unpopular opinion, but I think that ever since the Grammy's snubbed Kendrick the first time,they just throwing awards at him

Connor McGregor will lose Saturday and that combined with the Ronda Rousey loss may send Dana White into a deep depression #aldovsmcgregor
